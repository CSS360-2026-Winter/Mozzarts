NOTE: Some issues with slash commands on discord app, so a possible fix is the use of testing in the web browser for [discord](https://discord.com/)!

## This is the current state of the project

Memebers need to fork this project and then clone this Repo to start!

### Brainstorming:

We thought of a couple of ideas such as:

```
Gambling bot (Blackjack, Complex slots, Roullette, Poker)
Trivia bot (Music, Common Knowledge, Movies/Shows)
Game bot (Wordle, Uno/Card Games, Connect 4)
```

These are only a few but so far we are leaning towards a mix of the game/gambling bot!

### Chosen Bot:

We have chosen the:

```
Music trivia bot!
```

Now We are in the part of finding our requirements and functions!

Requirements:

1. Trivia of selected genres of music
2. Points
3. Leaderboard
