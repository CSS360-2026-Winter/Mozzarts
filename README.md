NOTE: Some issues with slash commands on discord app, so a possible fix is the use of testing in the web browser for [discord](https://discord.com/)!

## This is the current state of the project

Memebers need to fork this project and then clone this Repo to start!

### Brainstorming:

We thought of a couple of ideas such as:

```
Gambling bot (Blackjack, Complex slots, Roullette, Poker)
Trivia bot (Music, Common Knowledge, Movies/Shows)
Game bot (Wordle, Uno/Card Games, Connect 4)
```

These are only a few but so far we are leaning towards a mix of the game/gambling bot!

### Chosen Bot:

We have chosen the:

```
Music trivia bot!
```

Now We are in the part of finding our requirements and functions!

Requirements:

1. Trivia of selected genres of music
2. Points
3. Leaderboard

```
> # Version 1.0
### Arteen Ramezani - Release Notes:

```
- Added the bot trivia command:
  - When called the bot shows a preview which will contain a description and
    difficulties to pick from. Underneath the preview there are interactable
    buttons with difficulties the user can choose from which for now just displays
    music questions with multiple choice answers also as buttons. If the answer
    is correct, based on respective difficulty, the bot will "give" 1, 2, or 3 points
    to the user (tracking the points is a work in progress). If wrong, gives no points.
    Additionally after the user picks an answer, there is a display for Correct or
    Wrong which also shows the Question, Correct Answer, User's Answer, and
    the name of the question was answered by.
